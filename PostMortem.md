Physics Assesment PostMortem

  We managed to create a Physics based "Game" in 3D during this assessment and meet most of our goals that we presented in the production brief. All in all working in Unity with the Steam VR plugin was rather straightforward though there was difficulty in setting up the controllers to be able to grasp objects in a semi realistic manner as well as determing how best to handle player input. We successfully created a cannon for the player to interact with, it can be loaded with cannonballs provided in game and the player can rotate and fire it at a crowd of "enemies" that are rigged so that Ragdoll physics can take effect when they are hit with a cannonball or the sword that the player can pick up and swing at nearby enemies.
  
  Scripts are in place as well as a NavMesh so that enemies would be able to charge towards the player from the treeline but we were unable to incorporate them in the time allocated due to complications with getting rigged models moving around as well as getting a good speed for them to move at so it is possible for the player to actually hit them.
  
  We feel that the final product is a good example of our teams grasp of game physics as well as a knowledge of working in Steam VR which is a bit of a bonus.
